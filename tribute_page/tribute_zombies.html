					<h2>How to become a zombie?</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Anger a haitian bokor.</li>
						<li>Be an experimental material for a mad scientist.</li>
						<li>Expose yourself to radiation.</li>
						<li>Drink that newly created toxin.</li>
						<li>Get that weird new virus.</li>
						<li>Force a real zombie to byte you.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>The most true way involves eating or breathing in magic powder made by the bokor. Well, maybe not so magic, since it contains a poison from a local fish which will make your brains dead. And after that you'll have to work for the bokor. So I actually advise trying other possible ways.</p>
					<h2>How to get killed being a zombie?</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Be shot in the head with a rifle.</li>
						<li>Be decapitated.</li>
						<li>Burn in the fire.</li>			
					</ul>
					<p>However you can eat pretty anything, any poison will do you no harm (even those rotten brains). And regular wounds won't hurt or bleed. And probably you can walk underwater since you don't need to breathe. If you notice some of your own parts falling because of natural decay, you can always use a little of formaldehyde solution.</p>
					<h2>How to not get killed being a zombie?</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Wear a protective helmet.</li>
						<li>Wear a wide metal collar.</li>
						<li>Avoid petrol stations.</li>			
					</ul>
					<p>But you will probably forget all tips and advices after you become a zombie, so make all preparations before that.</p>
					<h2>What to eat?</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Brains. That's just classics.</li>
						<li>Flesh, since there won't be enough brains for all.</li>
						<li>Eat other zombies to show them who's the king.</li>			
					</ul>
					<p>Please, don't eat animals, remember - we have to protect the environment on our Planet.</p>
